## My Thoughts About The code and What makes it amazing code
For me this code is already good. The use of dependency injection for injecting the BookingRepository is a good practice. It makes the code more testable and allows for better decoupling of components.The controller methods are relatively short and focused on specific actions, which is a good practice. Each method appears to handle a specific functionality related to job bookings. The controller relies on a repository pattern, which is a good architectural choice. It abstracts away the data access logic and keeps the controller focused on handling HTTP requests.

## My Thoughts About The code and which part can be improve:
* The first one is on BaseRepository class. On this class there's a one function that need to be refactored which is '_validate' function. I think with the typing name like this, it's Incosistent and lack of clarity. So, I change it to handleValidation(). Also on the '_validate' function there's a unclear between return and throw, This function has to give the spesific return or throw, What I see is this function has a throw and return on the validation fails process.
* The second is on BookRepository and BookController class. Here is what I had found and need to be improved from this class:
  * The parameter on the function. The parameter need to be spesific what type of parameter need to pass when calling that function. What I saw is there's lack of clarity
    what type of the parameter from the function, also a few function has not a clear documentation. For example there's a function called `jobToData($job)`. In this
    function, it does not provide clarity about what process this function will carry out. The parameters that must be provided also lack clarity, what type must be provided
    when calling the function, whether array or collection. Maybe some developers will be able to immediately tell when looking at the statement in the function that the
    '$jobs' parameter will call an attribute from the 'Job' model class, however it would be better to give the 'Job' model type to the function parameter, so that when
    developers
    read the function, they will immediately understand what data must be provided to the function, apart from that, if there is an 'error' when sending data when callingthe 
    function, the editor will immediately give a warning.
  * There are several variables that are not used
  *  It's better using Carbon (But this is a preferences): Object-Oriented Approach: Carbon provides an object-oriented approach to working with dates and times. It returns
     Carbon objects, which have nnumerous methods for manipulating dates and times. Immutable: Carbon objects are immutable, meaning that methods like add() or sub() don't
     modify the original object
     but return a new one. This can help prevent unexpected side effects in your code.
     Readability and Convenience: Carbon methods are often more readable and convenient than using the procedural date() function. For example, $date->format('Y-m-d H:i:s')
     in Carbon is more readable than date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $timestamp).
     Localization: Carbon supports localization and provides an easy way to format dates and times based on different locales.
     Additional Functionality: Carbon comes with additional functionality for dealing with time zones, diffing dates, human-readable date intervals, and more.
  * There are some queries taken with ORM that do not follow best practices. For Example: when retrieving a query for `translatorJobRel` in the updateJob() function data
    that has no or null in the `cancel_at` column. Instead of retrieving it with the query `->where('cancel_at', null)`, we can search for it with the function `
    ->whereNull('cancel_at')
  * There's a few condition which can be refactor for more clean code. For example:
    <code>
    if (!empty($job->user_email)) {
            $email = $job->user_email;
        } else {
            $email = $user->email;
        }
    </code>
    Instead, we can use
    <code>
    $email = $job->user_email ?? $user->email;
    </code>
  * There's a few repeated code that can be optimized. While looking at the statement function, I found there is unnecessary repetitive code and I already refactor it. For
    example on the `getAll(Request $request, $limit = null)` function. What i see, this function is getting all the jobs data based on spesific `user_type`, then when i saw
    it, there's repeated condition for checking request and filter between user_type admin and not. So, I had refactore the condition to avoid repetitive code.
  * There is also some code that is not standardized. In my opinion, when building a project using any framework or language, we must standardize our code, especially if
    working as a team. By standardizing our code, we can maintain our code more in a structured manner, Reduced Learning Curve, Standardized code makes the code review
    process more efficient, Readability and Maintainability. One example of code that in my opinion does not follow standardization is in the `BookingController` class, when
    returning responses for data, there are several functions that use `response()->json($data)` but there are also those that only use `response( $data). And also, we still
    haven't utilized Laravel Resources to standardize API responses.
